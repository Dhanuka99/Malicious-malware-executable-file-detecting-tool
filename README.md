<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p> Modern anti-virus and anti-malware solutions use a combination of mutliple methodologies in order to provide accurate diagnosis. Clamp is quite simply a basic implementation for detecting malware. It can't be used to replace the commercial grade anti-virus engines since it makes use of techniques that are rudimentary as well as not enough to account for all possible threats. </p>
<p>The present-day threats are ever-evolving and there is simply no perfect solution. It's <i>a cat and mouse game</i> with anti-virus vendors having to play catch-up with the malicious actors.
